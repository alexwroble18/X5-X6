Introduction (Problem/Primary Stakeholder): 
            Within used car shops, the most important problem that companies face is matching potential customers to cars that they are likely to buy, whether it be for the discount or model. My program will help to organize a shop’s limited-space sales floor to reflect customer needs and increase revenue, through priority queues tracking current and future inventory in order to showcase the best cars and discounts on the sales floor, each day. Ideally, the car shop has a record of receiving inventory one week into the future in order to show changes in organization for the day.
            The primary user of the program would be employees of car shops, not only for purposes of ideal vehicle organization, but also to the customers’ satisfaction. The GUI (Figure I) provides a user-friendly interaction template that makes frequent computations easy. Data would be loaded in from values from a CSV file (Figure II). The program would also use a CSV file for data storage, utilizing an efficient heap to track and manipulate high-priority values.
